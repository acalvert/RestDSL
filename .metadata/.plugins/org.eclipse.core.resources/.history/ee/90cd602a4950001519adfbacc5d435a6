on construction, take in a translation unit, set up a string builder from 
	keep a set of edits to be made and then decide what to replace at runtime?
		- check for overlapping when a new edit is added and combine edits when needed
		- how to handle offsets (offset into old version or just-changed version?)

necessary methods 
	- offsets should all be file offsets, since that what comes from AST
	- offsets should refer to offset after changes have been made, not the original file offsets
		- ie, remove(10, 3) insert(10, "lol") adds text when insert(10, "lol") remove(10, 3) has no net effect
